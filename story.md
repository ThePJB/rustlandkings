Rusting Pilgrims
----------------
Well you see these sentient robots live forever and they have no purpose.
So one day for some reason they gain purpose, to pilgrim to 'Mecha', the site of creation of the first sentient robot

roguelike so you just die on the way a lot of the time then you are a different dude

maybe someone made a virus to make them odi t and its just like a test of skills

You would probably encounter other pilgrims on the Path. Disclose narrative. Trade stuff. personalities eg generous sociopath etc

some might switch off meaning.exe and go home
or just chill

searching for meaning in a super calculated robotic way

what if you could be like, i want to stop doing this, then just patch yourself
guy at end is just patching them not to care
but what do you care about or do you just self destruct
blue pill, patch and just put on a shelf somewhere, in a line of other ones. then that becomes like your score tracker thing
and you sit there and rust. its like a quad entendre


different robots: serial + name DBFX3-559-234 'Slim Joe'

-----------
eat guns -> metal -> for upgrading yourself
or for crafting guns
or enemy pieces -> scrap metal for upgrade. find a 3d printer lol
pick up the guns that the enemies have - transparency
