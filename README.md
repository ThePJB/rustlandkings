terrain generation

    graph substitution grammar?
    CA?
    random walk?

fix sliding along walls.  if you are travelling diagonally you still hitch a bit

design
------

ok its a bit like super crate box

your inventory is just a list of guns and you go through them in order, single use
you can also eat them to regain hp
maybe throw them and they explode or something
alt fire

proc gen guns
effect when eaten etc

maybe take them to somewhere in the world and it juices them but then you have to pick them up and they go to back of queue
and you would be big anticipate

so yeah there would be a lot of snap planning, adapting etc
