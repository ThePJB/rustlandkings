design

ok its a bit like super crate box

your inventory is just a list of guns and you go through them in order, single use
you can also eat them to regain hp
maybe throw them and they explode or something
alt fire

proc gen guns
effect when eaten etc

maybe take them to somewhere in the world and it juices them but then you have to pick them up and they go to back of queue
and you would be big anticipate

so yeah there would be a lot of snap planning, adapting etc

spitegun: if it gets shot it shoots lol


todo maybe factor out collisiongroup and force
to handle collision filtering a bit more elegantly
